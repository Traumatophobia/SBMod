If you want to compile the mod yourself:
1: Get eclipse or any other IDE
2: Download the Forge SRC
3: Extract the SRC into a file
4: Open CMD in the folder and type 'gradlew setupDevWorkspace eclipse'
5: When that is done, copy the SRC folder to replace the SRC folder created.
6: Open CMD again in the folder and type 'gradlew.bat build'
